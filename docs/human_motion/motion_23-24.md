#### 1. Synthesizing Moving People with 3D Control

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
In this paper, we present a diffusion model-based framework for animating people from a single image for a given target 3D motion sequence. Our approach has two core components: a) learning priors about invisible parts of the human body and clothing, and b) rendering novel body poses with proper clothing and texture. For the first part, we learn an in-filling diffusion model to hallucinate unseen parts of a person given a single image. We train this model on texture map space, which makes it more sample-efficient since it is invariant to pose and viewpoint. Second, we develop a diffusion-based rendering pipeline, which is controlled by 3D human poses. This produces realistic renderings of novel poses of the person, including clothing, hair, and plausible in-filling of unseen regions. This disentangled approach allows our method to generate a sequence of images that are faithful to the target motion in the 3D pose and, to the input image in terms of visual similarity. In addition to that, the 3D control allows various synthetic camera trajectories to render a person. Our experiments show that our method is resilient in generating prolonged motions and varied challenging and complex poses compared to prior methods.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Crowd Motion Generation is essential in entertainment industries such as animation and games as well as in strategic fields like urban simulation and planning. This new task requires an intricate integration of control and generation to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial and semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored. On the one hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. On the other hand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on pre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person interactions, thus hampering their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence into the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling generalizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training data. Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that learns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts or introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that efficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic plans. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the effectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by providing scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task but also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
In the realm of motion generation, the creation of long-duration, high-quality motion sequences remains a significant challenge. This paper presents our groundbreaking work on "Infinite Motion", a novel approach that leverages long text to extended motion generation, effectively bridging the gap between short and long-duration motion synthesis. Our core insight is the strategic extension and reassembly of existing high-quality text-motion datasets, which has led to the creation of a novel benchmark dataset to facilitate the training of models for extended motion sequences. A key innovation of our model is its ability to accept arbitrary lengths of text as input, enabling the generation of motion sequences tailored to specific narratives or scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate the timestamp design for text which allows precise editing of local segments within the generated sequences, offering unparalleled control and flexibility in motion synthesis. We further demonstrate the versatility and practical utility of "Infinite Motion" through three specific applications: natural language interactive editing, motion sequence editing within long sequences and splicing of independent motion sequences. Each application highlights the adaptability of our approach and broadens the spectrum of possibilities for research and development in motion generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model in generating long sequence motions compared to existing methods.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
The generation of humanoid animation from text prompts can profoundly impact animation production and AR/VR experiences. However, existing methods only generate body motion data, excluding facial expressions and hand movements. This limitation, primarily due to a lack of a comprehensive whole-body motion dataset, inhibits their readiness for production use. Recent attempts to create such a dataset have resulted in either motion inconsistency among different body parts in the artificially augmented data or lower quality in the data extracted from RGB videos. In this work, we propose T2M-X, a two-stage method that learns expressive text-to-motion generation from partially annotated data. T2M-X trains three separate Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) for body, hand, and face on respective high-quality data sources to ensure high-quality motion outputs, and a Multi-indexing Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model with motion consistency loss for motion generation and coordination among different body parts. Our results show significant improvements over the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating its robustness against the dataset limitations.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
This research delves into the problem of interactive editing of human motion generation. Previous motion diffusion models lack explicit modeling of the word-level text-motion correspondence and good explainability, hence restricting their fine-grained editing ability. To address this issue, we propose an attention-based motion diffusion model, namely MotionCLR, with CLeaR modeling of attention mechanisms. Technically, MotionCLR models the in-modality and cross-modality interactions with self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. More specifically, the self-attention mechanism aims to measure the sequential similarity between frames and impacts the order of motion features. By contrast, the cross-attention mechanism works to find the fine-grained word-sequence correspondence and activate the corresponding timesteps in the motion sequence. Based on these key properties, we develop a versatile set of simple yet effective motion editing methods via manipulating attention maps, such as motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, and example-based motion generation, etc. For further verification of the explainability of the attention mechanism, we additionally explore the potential of action-counting and grounded motion generation ability via attention maps. Our experimental results show that our method enjoys good generation and editing ability with good explainability.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Human motion generation is a cut-edge area of research in generative computer vision, with promising applications in video creation, game development, and robotic manipulation. The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the go-to dataset, BABEL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a reduction of more than 57% in FID and 70% parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
